## Udacity Advanced Data Analysis
**Data Analysis Nanodegree Projects Repository**

Welcome to my Data Analysis Nanodegree projects repository! Here, you can find my solutions for the second and third projects completed during my journey with Udacity.

#### Projects Overview:

* **Project 2 -  `A/B Test Analysis for E-commerce Website`**
   
   Description: In this project, a company has developed a new web page with the goal of increasing the number of users. The main objective is to determine the page's appeal to customers through an A/B test. I have conducted the A/B test and thoroughly examined the results to provide a comprehensive report.
   
* **Project 3 - `Visualization for Prosper Loan-Data`**

   Description: This project focused on visualizing data relationships within a comprehensive loan dataset. The dataset encompasses 113,937 loan records, with each loan comprising 81 variables such as loan amount, borrower rate (interest rate), current loan status, borrower income, and more.

#### About the Projects:

I completed these projects in 2021, and they were some of my earliest experiences with both Python and Data Analysis. Although I am considering removing them, I have decided to keep them here for educational purposes. These projects do not serve as representative samples of my work, yet I think it's helpful and easy to understand and replicate for beginners.

Feel free to explore the projects and learn from them. If you have any questions or suggestions, please don't hesitate to reach out!
